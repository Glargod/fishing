    <div class="section" id="key-points">
        <h2>Key Points</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The 21-year-old (21 yo), a co-owner of the vehicle, was charged with stunting (170 km/h in a 110 km/h zone) and driving without insurance (not listed on the policy), holding a Class 7 (Learner's) license.</li>
            <li>The parent, as the registered owner, faces impoundment fees and potential vehicle registration suspension.</li>
            <li>The 21 yo faces a $2,400 stunting fine, $1,250 no-insurance fine, 6-month license suspension, and 6 demerit points.</li>
            <li>Both may see insurance premium increases; the 21 yo will face high-risk insurance costs for 3–6 years.</li>
            <li>Co-ownership complicates insurance but not legal penalties.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="penalties-parent">
        <h2>Penalties for the Parent</h2>
        <p>As the registered owner, the parent’s liabilities stem from the vehicle’s registration and insurance status. The 21 yo’s co-ownership does not shift these responsibilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Impoundment Fees</strong>: The parent must pay towing and storage fees for the 7-day impoundment due to the stunting charge, typically <strong>$300–$500</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Vehicle Registration Suspension</strong>: Under Section 230(1) and Section 205 of the <em>Motor Vehicle Act</em>, driving without insurance (21 yo not listed on the policy) may lead to suspension of the vehicle’s registration until proof of insurance for all drivers is provided.</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance Premium Increases</strong>: The parent’s insurance premiums may rise due to an unlisted household driver (the 21 yo, a co-owner) operating the vehicle. Insurers may view this as a policy breach, potentially leading to higher rates or cancellation risk.</li>
            <li><strong>No Criminal Liability</strong>: The parent faces no fines or license suspension, as they weren’t driving. Penalties are administrative or financial.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="penalties-21yo">
        <h2>Penalties for the 21-Year-Old</h2>
        <p>As co-owner and driver with a Class 7 license, the 21 yo faces penalties for stunting and driving without insurance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stunting Penalties</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fine</strong>: $2,400 for driving 170 km/h in a 110 km/h zone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Demerit Points</strong>: 6 points, triggering a <strong>6-month license suspension</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>GDL Impact</strong>: Resets 12-month Class 7 period (8 months with driver training), delaying Class 5N. Post-suspension, pays ~$115 reinstatement fee and may retake tests.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Driving Without Insurance</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fine</strong>: $1,250 ($1,000 penalty, $100 court costs, $150 victim surcharge) for not being listed on the policy.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Insurance Impact</strong>: High-risk status, with premiums potentially $5,000–$8,000/year for 3–6 years. High-risk insurers may require upfront payment.</li>
            <li><strong>Co-Ownership</strong>: Being on the title doesn’t increase legal penalties but complicates insurance, as co-owners in the household must be listed on the policy.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="future-prospects">
        <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Short-Term (1–2 Years)</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>21 yo</strong>: No driving for 6 months, disrupting work/school. Fines ($3,650 total), impound fees (if shared), and reinstatement costs (~$115) strain finances. Living with parents eases transport but may cause tension.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parent</strong>: Pays $300–$500 impound fees and faces potential registration suspension, requiring insurance updates. Premium increases add pressure.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Long-Term (3–5 Years)</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>21 yo</strong>: High insurance costs persist for 3–6 years. A clean record allows GDL progression (Class 5N, then Class 5 in ~2–3 years). Driving-related jobs may be affected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parent</strong>: Insurance stabilizes if 21 yo is added to the policy and no further incidents occur. Registration issues resolve with compliance.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Family Dynamics</strong>: Co-ownership and registration suggest shared responsibility, possibly straining relations. The parent’s Indigenous status may offer access to legal aid or community support.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="recommendations">
        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legal</strong>: Consult a lawyer to explore reducing charges (stunting or no insurance), though difficult. Paying fines accepts convictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance</strong>: Both should update the policy to list the 21 yo as a driver to avoid future violations. The 21 yo should compare high-risk insurer quotes.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial</strong>: Budget for fines ($3,650 for 21 yo, $300–$500 for parent) and fees to avoid penalties like jail (rare for first offenses).</li>
            <li><strong>Driving</strong>: Post-suspension, the 21 yo must adhere to Class 7 rules (supervision, zero BAC, curfew). Driver training could shorten GDL and improve insurance prospects.</li>
        </ul>
