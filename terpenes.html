            <h2>Detailed Terpene Profiles</h2>
            <p>The following section provides a deeper dive into the cannabis terpenes listed above, including their significance, effects, and associated strains, based on current research as of April 11, 2025.</p>
            
            <h3>Background and Context</h3>
            <p>Cannabis terpenes are aromatic compounds found in the trichomes of the cannabis plant, contributing to its distinctive smell, taste, and potentially its therapeutic effects. Research suggests they may work synergistically with cannabinoids like THC and CBD, a phenomenon known as the entourage effect. This section elaborates on the terpenes, their effects, and strains, drawing from reliable sources.</p>
            
            <h3>Methodology and Sources</h3>
            <p>The information was compiled from reputable sources, including Cannacon.org, NuggMD, Mellow Fellow, and The Healing Clinics. These were chosen for their detailed insights into terpene profiles, effects, and strain associations. The analysis involved cross-referencing to ensure accuracy, focusing on the two most significant effects and two strains per terpene.</p>
            
            <h3>Terpene Details</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Myrcene</strong>: The most common terpene in cannabis, known for sedative and anti-inflammatory properties. Found in strains like Mango Kush, Skunk XL, Grand Daddy Purple, and OG Kush, it’s noted for pain relief and inflammation reduction.</li>
                <li><strong>Limonene</strong>: Recognized for mood-enhancing and stress-relieving effects, with anti-inflammatory benefits. Common in Sour Diesel and Super Lemon Haze, it’s associated with stress reduction.</li>
                <li><strong>Linalool</strong>: Known for calming and anti-anxiety effects, found in Amnesia Haze and Lavender. It’s valued for its anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
                <li><strong>Caryophyllene</strong>: Notable for anti-inflammatory effects and aiding arthritis or gastrointestinal issues. Found in Girl Scout Cookies, Sour Diesel, Zkittles, and Bubba Kush.</li>
                <li><strong>Alpha-pinene and Beta-pinene</strong>: Both offer anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator effects, common in Jack Herer and Blue Dream, aiding respiratory health.</li>
                <li><strong>Alpha-bisabolol</strong>: Enhances absorption and provides analgesic effects, found in Harle-Tsu and Pink Kush.</li>
                <li><strong>Eucalyptol</strong>: Relieves pain and reduces inflammation, present in Super Lemon Haze and Girl Scout Cookies.</li>
                <li><strong>Trans-nerolidol</strong>: Offers antiparasitic and antioxidant properties, found in Sweet Skunk and Island Sweet Skunk.</li>
                <li><strong>Humulene</strong>: Known for anti-proliferative effects and appetite suppression, common in Sour Diesel and Girl Scout Cookies.</li>
                <li><strong>Delta 3 Carene</strong>: Aids bone healing and cognitive function, found in Arjan’s Ultra Haze and Bubba Kush.</li>
                <li><strong>Camphene</strong>: Acts as an antioxidant and lowers cholesterol, present in Ghost OG and Strawberry Banana.</li>
                <li><strong>Borneol</strong>: Serves as an insect repellent and has anti-cancer properties, found in Kali Mist and Hindu Kush.</li>
                <li><strong>Terpineol</strong>: Offers anti-depressant and neuroprotective effects, common in Jack Herer and White Widow.</li>
                <li><strong>Valencene</strong>: Provides anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic benefits, found in Tangie and Agent Orange.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Strain Variability and Considerations</h3>
            <p>Strain associations can vary due to cultivation methods, regional differences, and testing standards. For example, some sources list Zkittles for Caryophyllene, while others highlight Girl Scout Cookies. Users should check product-specific terpene profiles via dispensary websites or labels.</p>
            
            <h3>Limitations and Future Research</h3>
            <p>Terpene effects are not universal and depend on individual physiology, dosage, and consumption method. The entourage effect is still under study, and more research is needed to confirm benefits. Strain potency varies, so consulting healthcare professionals is advised for medical use.</p>
            
            <h3>Practical Implications</h3>
            <p>Understanding terpene profiles can guide strain selection. For pain relief, consider Myrcene-rich Mango Kush; for stress, Limonene-rich Sour Diesel. Availability and legal status vary, so check local dispensaries or resources like Cannacon.</p>
