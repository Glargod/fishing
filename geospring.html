        <h2>Historical Context and Pioneers</h2>
        <p>Springhill's mine-water geothermal system, operational since the late 1980s, is one of the world's earliest examples of repurposing flooded abandoned coal mines for clean energy. Local experts and businesses played key roles in its development, including refrigeration specialists who advanced heat pump applications.</p>
        <p>Notably, Ralph Ross (of Ross Refrigeration) contributed significantly to bringing geothermal energy to Springhill, advocating for its preservation and expansion against competing land uses such as proposed strip mining.</p>
        <p>This proposal for expanded hybrid clusters represents a continuation of that legacy by Ralph's son, Andrew Ross.</p>

    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The system exploits ~4 million m³ of water at proven 18–20°C (deeper potential ~26°C) in flooded mines, heated primarily by normal rock conduction with negligible chemical contribution. Proven for heating/cooling commercial sites; electricity conceptual due to low temperatures.</p>

    <section id="higher-temp">
        <h2>Potential for Higher Temperatures</h2>
        <p>Proven mine water temperatures are 18–20°C from shallow-mid depths, attributed to natural geothermal gradient and convection (up to 11°C above normal groundwater). Deeper access (mines reached >4 km historically) could yield warmer water (~26°C+ speculated), enhancing efficiency.</p>
        <p>Historical underground fires/explosions occurred in active mines; a surface waste bank fire has smoldered periodically. No evidence of active underground coal seam fires significantly heating flooded workings—heat is dominantly conductive, not exothermic. Anomalous hot zones from residual fires remain unlikely post-flooding.</p>
        <p>Exploratory deeper wells could confirm warmer veins—worth investigating for upside potential.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="hybrid-clusters">
        <h2>Hybrid Clusters Definition</h2>
        <p><strong>Hybrid clusters</strong> are distributed modular sites combining primary thermal use (heating/cooling via heat pumps) with supplementary low-temperature electricity (binary ORC) from the same mine water.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2–3 wells/shafts per cluster.</li>
            <li>Thermal priority (COP 3–5); cascaded residual to ORC.</li>
            <li>Per cluster: Hundreds kW–MW thermal; tens–300 kW electrical (higher if warmer water found).</li>
            <li>Distributed across dozens of access points for balanced draw and synergies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Is This Worth Proposing?</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Yes—absolutely worth proposing expanded hybrid clusters</strong> for residential district heating (with supplementary ORC electricity), including exploratory deeper wells for potential warmer water.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proven Foundation</strong>: 35+ years reliable commercial heating; ongoing provincial studies and global mine-water district successes.</li>
                <li><strong>Realistic Impact</strong>: 3–8 clusters cover near-full residential heating in a 50/50 mix—feasible with existing wells/shafts.</li>
                <li><strong>Upside Potential</strong>: Deeper drilling could access warmer zones, boosting efficiency/power.</li>
                <li><strong>Low-Risk Path</strong>: Start with heating pilots; add modular ORC for bonus power.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment</strong>: Supports NS clean energy goals, community resilience, and post-mining renewal.</li>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Building on the pioneering efforts of Ralph Ross, continued by his son Andrew Ross, hybrid clusters offer a grounded path to community-wide efficient heating—enhanced by potential deeper warmer access. With a realistic 50/50 residential mix, full coverage is achievable with a handful of clusters—well worth pursuing for lasting continuity.</p>
